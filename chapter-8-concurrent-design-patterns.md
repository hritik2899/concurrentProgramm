- Need for careful consideration of performance implications

## 2. Code Examples

### 2.1 Thread Pool Pattern

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is being executed by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000);
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
                }
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
        try {
            if (!executor.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                executor.shutdownNow();
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            executor.shutdownNow();
        }

        System.out.println("All tasks completed");
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Future Pattern

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FuturePatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println("Calculating...");
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            return 42;
        });

        System.out.println("Do something else while calculating...");

        Integer result = future.get(); // This will block until the result is available
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### 2.3 Reader-Writer Lock Pattern

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class ReaderWriterLockExample {
    private final ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    private int data = 0;

    public int readData() {
        rwLock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is reading data: " + data);
            return data;
        } finally {
            rwLock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public void writeData(int newValue) {
        rwLock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is writing data: " + newValue);
            data = newValue;
        } finally {
            rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReaderWriterLockExample example = new ReaderWriterLockExample();

        // Create multiple reader threads
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            new Thread(example::readData, "Reader-" + i).start();
        }

        // Create a writer thread
        new Thread(() -> example.writeData(42), "Writer").start();

        // Create more reader threads
        for (int i = 5; i < 10; i++) {
            new Thread(example::readData, "Reader-" + i).start();
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Important Use Cases and Scenarios

1. **Web Servers**: Using thread pools to manage incoming client requests efficiently
2. **Task Scheduling Systems**: Implementing producer-consumer pattern for task distribution
3. **Database Management Systems**: Applying reader-writer locks for concurrent access to data
4. **GUI Applications**: Using active object pattern to keep UI responsive while performing background tasks
5. **Caching Systems**: Implementing double-checked locking for lazy initialization of cache entries
6. **Parallel Computing Frameworks**: Using barriers for synchronization in parallel algorithms

## 4. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices:
1. Choose the appropriate pattern based on the specific concurrency requirements
2. Combine patterns when necessary to address complex scenarios
3. Consider performance implications when applying patterns
4. Document the use of concurrent design patterns in your code
5. Use higher-level concurrency utilities provided by the language/framework when possible
6. Test concurrent code thoroughly, including stress testing and race condition checks

### Common Pitfalls:
1. Overusing complex patterns when simpler solutions would suffice
2. Incorrect implementation of patterns leading to race conditions or deadlocks
3. Neglecting proper error handling and resource cleanup in concurrent code
4. Assuming that using a pattern automatically makes code thread-safe
5. Ignoring the impact of patterns on system performance and scalability
6. Failing to consider the interaction between different patterns used in the same system
