# Chapter 7: Parallel Algorithms and Data Structures

## 1. Theoretical Explanations

### 1.1 Parallel Algorithms
- Algorithms designed to be executed simultaneously on multiple processors
- Goal: Solve problems faster by utilizing multiple computing resources
- Key concepts: Decomposition, load balancing, communication, synchronization

### 1.2 Types of Parallelism
- Data Parallelism: Same operation applied to different elements of data
- Task Parallelism: Different operations performed on different or same data
- Pipeline Parallelism: Task divided into a series of stages, each processed in parallel

### 1.3 Parallel Algorithm Design Techniques
- Divide and Conquer: Recursively break down problem into subproblems
- Master-Worker: Distribute tasks from a master to multiple worker processes
- MapReduce: Map function applied in parallel, followed by reduce operation

### 1.4 Concurrent Data Structures
- Thread-safe data structures designed for concurrent access
- Examples: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, BlockingQueue

### 1.5 Performance Metrics
- Speedup: Ratio of sequential execution time to parallel execution time
- Efficiency: Speedup divided by the number of processors
- Amdahl's Law: Theoretical speedup limited by the sequential portion of the program

## 2. Code Examples

### 2.1 Parallel Merge Sort

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;

public class ParallelMergeSort extends RecursiveAction {
    private final int[] array;
    private final int start;
    private final int end;
    private static final int THRESHOLD = 1000;

    public ParallelMergeSort(int[] array, int start, int end) {
        this.array = array;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        if (end - start <= THRESHOLD) {
            Arrays.sort(array, start, end);
        } else {
            int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            ParallelMergeSort left = new ParallelMergeSort(array, start, mid);
            ParallelMergeSort right = new ParallelMergeSort(array, mid, end);
            invokeAll(left, right);
            merge(start, mid, end);
        }
    }

    private void merge(int start, int mid, int end) {
        int[] temp = Arrays.copyOfRange(array, start, end);
        int i = 0, j = mid - start, k = start;
        while (i < mid - start && j < end - start) {
            if (temp[i] <= temp[j]) {
                array[k++] = temp[i++];
            } else {
                array[k++] = temp[j++];
            }
        }
        while (i < mid - start) {
            array[k++] = temp[i++];
        }
    }

    public static void parallelMergeSort(int[] array) {
        ForkJoinPool pool = ForkJoinPool.commonPool();
        pool.invoke(new ParallelMergeSort(array, 0, array.length));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = new int[100000];
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            array[i] = (int) (Math.random() * 1000000);
        }

        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        parallelMergeSort(array);
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

        System.out.println("Sorted in " + (end - start) + " ms");
        System.out.println("Is sorted: " + isSorted(array));
    }

    private static boolean isSorted(int[] array) {
        for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (array[i - 1] > array[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### 2.2 Concurrent Hash Map Example

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

public class ConcurrentHashMapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            final String key = "Key" + i;
            executorService.submit(() -> {
                map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? 1 : v + 1);
            });
        }

        executorService.shutdown();
        executorService.awaitTermination(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);

        System.out.println("Map size: " + map.size());
        System.out.println("Value of Key0: " + map.get("Key0"));
    }
}
```

## 4. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices:
1. Design algorithms with parallelism in mind from the start
2. Use appropriate granularity to balance parallelism and overhead
3. Minimize shared mutable state to reduce synchronization overhead
4. Use parallel collections and algorithms provided by the language/framework when possible
5. Implement proper load balancing to ensure even distribution of work
6. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance

### Common Pitfalls:
1. Over-parallelization leading to increased overhead and reduced performance
2. Ignoring data dependencies, leading to race conditions or incorrect results
3. Inefficient load balancing, causing some processors to be underutilized
4. Excessive synchronization, reducing the benefits of parallelism
5. Neglecting the impact of memory access patterns on performance
6. Assuming linear speedup with the number of processors (ignoring Amdahl's Law)
